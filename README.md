# PID-controller-A-PID-Control-System-for-Inclination-Control.
UAV Stability and Control Project  Implemented a PID controller to enhance UAV stability and control in dynamic settings. Merged mechanical and electronics engineering skills using ATmega328p and an IMU sensor (accelerometer and gyroscope) connected through the I2C protocol.
